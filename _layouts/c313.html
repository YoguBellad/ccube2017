Over 80 technical experts from academic and industry had participated in paper blind review process. Based on review results, the technical program committee could accept only 41 papers for presentation in the main track and 13 presentations in the student track.
All accepted papers were presented. (No-show policy was implemented in the conference). Two best paper awards each in the main track and student track were instituted (by Dr. H N Shivashankar, Director, RNSIT).
